### üß† About this folder

This folder contains a collection of Python scripts I wrote during my INF-103 class at Bergen Community College.  
It‚Äôs part of my Cybersecurity degree and was one of the first steps in learning how to code and solve problems logically using Python.

Each script was part of different homework assignments, covering things like variables, conditionals, loops, functions, file handling, and a bit of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

These scripts represent how I learned to break problems into smaller pieces and write clear, simple solutions.

He helped me build a solid foundation that I‚Äôm now using in more advanced projects. Thank you, Professor!
