#This Python program simulates a traffic court judge deciding speeding cases in New Jersey. The script takes the posted speed limit and the driverâ€™s recorded speed as input, 
#calculates how many miles over the limit the driver was traveling, and determines whether the driver should receive a fine and penalty points. 
#If the driver is not speeding, the program confirms no fines or points.

sspeedLimit = int(input('Please inform posted speed limit: \n'))  # Get from user the speed limit
actualSpeed = int(input('Please inform the actual speed the car was: \n'))  # Get from user the actual speed of the car

# Calculate how many miles over the speed limit
speedOverLimit = actualSpeed - speedLimit  

# Use if / elif / else to compare the excess speed to the points and fines assessed
# Speed Over Limit    Fine        Points
# 1-9 mph             $85         2
