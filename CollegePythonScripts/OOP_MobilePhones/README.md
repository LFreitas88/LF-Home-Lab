## 🧠 Overview

This mini-project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python by defining a `Mobile` class that represents a real-world mobile phone.

It focuses on:
- Class creation and instance attributes  
- Using `self` within methods  
- Simulating realistic phone behaviors (calling, gaming, etc.)  
- Importing classes across Python modules
