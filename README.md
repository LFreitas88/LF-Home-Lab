# 🧠 LF-Home-Lab

Welcome to **LF-Home-Lab** — my personal environment for learning, building, and organizing everything related to **Python**, **AI**, **Cybersecurity**, and **automation**.  
This repository serves as a central place to keep my scripts, system setups, and documentation from different study projects, online courses, and personal experiments.

### 💡 About this repository

This is where I bring together everything I’ve been working on — from small Python scripts to full AI deployments and server setups.  
Each folder represents part of my learning process or the structure I use in my Home Lab to keep things organized, reproducible, and easy to maintain.

The goal of this repo is simple:  
→ Learn by doing.  
→ Build tools that actually work.  
→ Keep my lab clean, documented, and evolving.
